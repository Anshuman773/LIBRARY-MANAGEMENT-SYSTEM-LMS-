### Library Management System (LMS) | C, LCS

**July 2024**

**Project Description:**
- Developed a Library Management System (LMS) using C with advanced algorithms to manage and retrieve book records efficiently.
- Integrated key functionalities including adding, updating, and deleting book records, and performing sophisticated searches based on various criteria.

**Key Algorithms:**

**1. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):**
- Utilized the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm to improve search functionality based on author and title criteria.
- The LCS algorithm finds the longest sequence common to two strings, aiding in fuzzy matching and more flexible search queries.
- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two input strings.

**2. Hash Table:**
- Employed a custom hash table for efficient data retrieval and management of book records.
- Implemented a hash function to map book titles, authors, and ISBNs to unique indices within the hash table, enabling rapid access and update operations.
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) average case for insertions, deletions, and lookups, assuming minimal collisions.

**Automated Searching Function:**
- Developed an automated search function using the LCS algorithm for similarity-based queries and a hash table for exact matches.
- The function adjusts for similarities and efficiently retrieves relevant search results based on user input, enhancing the accuracy and speed of book retrieval.

**Features:**
- **Book Management:** Efficiently manage book records with capabilities to add, update, and delete entries.
- **Search Optimization:** Implement LCS for fuzzy matching and hash tables for rapid exact searches.
- **Automated Search:** Combine LCS and hash table techniques to provide dynamic and accurate search results based on various search criteria.

**Objective:**
- To enhance the LMS's search functionality and data management by leveraging both LCS for similarity matching and hash tables for fast data retrieval, thereby improving overall user experience and system efficiency.

**Results:**
- Achieved a refined search mechanism that integrates LCS for flexible querying and hash tables for fast access, optimizing the retrieval of book records and providing accurate, relevant search results.
