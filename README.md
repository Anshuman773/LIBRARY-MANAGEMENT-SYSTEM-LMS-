# Online Bookstore Management System

## Abstract
The Online Bookstore Management System is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage bookstore operations using a Binary Search Tree (BST) for book cataloging, client administration, order processing, and inventory control. This project aims to address the limitations of traditional bookstore management systems by enhancing the speed and efficiency of book retrieval and management.

## Introduction
In today's technology-driven world, managing bookstore operations effectively is crucial. The Online Bookstore Management System leverages an integrated approach to handle various aspects of bookstore management, including book cataloging, client administration, order processing, and inventory control. This project utilizes the Binary Search Tree (BST) algorithm to enhance book management operations by providing efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of book data.

## Overview
This research paper explores how we can improve the retrieval and management of books efficiently using the Binary Search Tree (BST) algorithm. The project is developed using C language in Visual Studio Code. Each node in the BST stores book details, including the title, author, and other relevant data. The BST algorithm enables quick addition and retrieval of books, facilitating dynamic management and maintaining books in a sorted order.

## Problem Statement
The Online Bookstore Management System aims to overcome the challenges faced by traditional bookstore management systems, such as updating book information, organizing books in a specific order, and identifying high-demand books. The system seeks to provide a solution that enhances the efficiency of book-related processes and ensures that books are easily accessible and well-organized.

## Aim
- Utilize the Binary Search Tree (BST) algorithm to enhance book management operations.
- Ensure fast retrieval and update operations for books.
- Provide a seamless user experience with efficient book searching and management.

## About The Algorithm
- Storing books in a sorted order using the BST enhances overall performance.
- The time complexity for searching a book is O(log n) on average, where n denotes the number of nodes, and O(n) in the worst case if the BST is unbalanced.
- Inserting a book into the BST takes O(log n) on average and O(n) in the worst case if the tree is unbalanced.
- Deleting a book from the BST takes O(n) in the worst case if the tree is unbalanced.

## Input/Output
- **Input**: Book details (title, author, etc.) are entered and stored in the BST nodes.
- **Output**: The desired book is retrieved quickly when searched by the customer. The system also stores customer details and tracks the time taken to borrow and return books.

## Additional Features
- **Login System**: A secure login system for customers and administrators.
- **Borrow and Return System**: Efficient tracking of book borrowing and returning activities.
- **Advanced and Optimized Searching System**: Automated searching system tested with around 1 million book data, providing accurate results swiftly.

## Summary
The inherent properties of the BST allow for swift and logarithmic time complexity in search, insertion, and deletion operations, optimizing the overall performance of the bookstore application. The sorted nature of the BST ensures that books are stored in an organized manner, enhancing the user experience. This approach not only improves the efficiency of book-related processes but also contributes to the scalability and responsiveness of the online bookstore.
